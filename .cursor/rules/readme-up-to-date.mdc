After making changes, do a quick pass to ensure `README.md` is still up to date.

In particular, if you add/change any of the following, update the README in the same PR:
- New/changed environment variables (document name, purpose, default)
- New/changed CLI flags or usage examples
- Behavior changes that users would notice (e.g., logging, workflow steps, retries/timeouts)

Keep README updates concise and colocated with the relevant section.
